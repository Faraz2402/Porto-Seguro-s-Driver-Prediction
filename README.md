# Porto-Seguro-s-Driver-Prediction
Project Description: The aim of this challenge is to predict the probability whether a driver will make an insurance claim, with the purpose of providing a fairer insurance cost on the basis of individual driving habits. It is sponsored by Porto Seguro - a major car and home insurance company in Brazil.

Responsibility: In this project, I have used techniques like exploratory data analysis and machine learning. Extensive cleaning of data was performed.
I applied models like XG Boost which shrinks the feature weights to make the boosting process more conservative and Cross Validation for finding the optimal value of nrounds.
Also, Confusion Matrix was applied to check the performance of the classifier model, the accuracy I got was 63.26342% for Balanced Data and 96.26357% for Unbalanced Data.
